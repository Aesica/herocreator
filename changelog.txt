Changelog for HeroCreator

10/28/2016 - Aesica
 - Added the missing icon for the Sorcery form "Spellcaster."  Seems it wasn't uploaded for some reason.
 - Added tooltips to the export formatting options to help users decide which best suits their needs.
 - Fixed a bug that was causing talents to not update their superstat highlighting when selecting an archetype.
 - Fixed a bug that was causing Magician's Dust to not be selectable.
 - The Tempest now correctly offers Storm Summoner instead of Invocation of Storm Calling.

10/24/2016 - Aesica
 - Updated the Devastator, Void, Savage, and (this time for real!) Specialist archetypes to properly reflect what's in the game.
 - Added the Automaton back in. (Yeah, my bad!)
 - Added tooltip text for each archetype explaining how it's obtained as well as which role it gets assigned.
 - Added the rest of the missing icons.
 - Lightened the shade of gray used to denote unavailable powers, or talent stats that don't correspond with chosen superstats.
 - Added some advantages I overlooked in the initial pass, namely those associated with Skarn's Bane, Thundering Kicks, and a few others.
 - Removed export text coloring entirely, instead opting for combinations of bold, italic, and underlining to set things apart.  This allows the text to be more easily shown on a wider variety of forums--both light-themed and dark-themed.
 - Removed the on-click autoselect that happens when clicking the export textarea, allowing those who want to copy only a portion of the export to do so more easily.  The whole export can still be quickly selected for copy/pasta via the newly-added 'Quick Select' button.  It's the best of both worlds!

10/16/2016 - Aesica
 - Added and updated a crapton of powers and advantages, bringing the data inline with everything on the current live server.
 - Added more detailed tooltips for several powers (mainly the newer/more recently revised ones) and advantages to help give a clearer indication of what they do.  This is still ongoing.
 - Added an export option for Markdown (Discord, certain forums, etc).
 - Added fuctionality to auto-highlight the build link on the main page as well as the export textarea.
 - Added The Rockstar, The Predator, The Penitent, and The Hexslinger archetypes.
 - Updated The Specialist and The Grimoire archetypes.
 - Updated the layout and style a bit to distinguish this project from its parent, the PowerHouse.
 - Updated the export formatting slightly, most notably with the inclusion of advantage points spent and the way the build name, framework, and link are presented.
 - A few minor fixes most people won't even notice.
